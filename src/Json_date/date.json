However, if you experience swollen or bleeding gums (a condition known as gingivitis) or other forms of gum disease, your dentist may recommend more frequent visits. In some cases, adults with gum disease may need to see their dentist three to four times a year. Regular check-ups can help prevent the progression of gum disease into periodontitis, a serious condition that can lead to infection and tooth loss."
